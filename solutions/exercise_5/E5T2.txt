# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

- Regula (Terraform), cfripper (CloudFormation)

### Examples of vulnerabilities

The static code analysis is to check for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities or any violation of the Least Priviliged Principal in the IaC templates.

Examples of Regula rules:
- The EBS volume encryption should be enabled
- The CloudFront viewer protocol policy set to 'https-only' or 'redirect-to-https'
- Enable for S3 bucket server side encryption
- VPC security group rules should not permit ingress from '0.0.0.0/0', except ports 80 and port 443
- VPC security group rules should not permit ingress from '0.0.0.0/0' to port 22 (SSH)
- Enable KMS CMK rotation

Examples of cfripper rules:
- Validate any AWS::CloudFormation::Authentication resource does not contain plain text credentials
- Validate Security Groups should be defined with an egress policy, even when it's allowing all outbound traffic
- Validate any wildcard principals in any statements 
- Validate use of the wildcard * character in the Actions of Policy Documents of S3 Bucket Policies


##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for Operating Systems Vulnerabilities

- Anchore, Clair

### Example of Vulnerabilities

- Validate outdated version of the operating system
- Validate unapproved CVE vulnerabilities
- Validate Malware in images

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

- AWS Inspector
- AWS Config
- AWS Security Hub

### Example of Vulnerabilities

General validations that needs to perform:

- Validate that IAM policies follows the least privilege principle
- Validate whether Security Groups with 0.0.0.0/0 allow only specific inbound TCP or UDP traffic. 
- Validate whether the MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enabled for root account

Examples of AWS Inspector rules:
- Validate whether the ports from the internet through an internet gateway (including instances behind Application Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers) are reachable, a VPC peering connection, or a VPN through virtual gateway. 
These also highlights the network configurations that allow for potentially malicious access, such as mismanaged security groups, ACLs, IGWs, etc.
- Validate whether the EC2 instances in the assessment targets are exposed to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). 
- Attacks can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service or data. 
- CVE system that provides a reference method for publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures.

Examples of AWS Config rules (triggers the evaluation when any resource that matches the rule's scope changes in configuration):
- Validate the encryption of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes
- Validate whether the AWS Identity and Access Management users have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled
- Validate whether Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances have a public IP association
- Validate that the Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public read/write access
